# Welcome to transformerkp library

A transformers based deep learning library for keyphrase identification from text documents.

** transformerkp ** is:

* **A deep learning keyphrase extraction and generation library** - transformerkp allows you to train and apply state-of-the-art 
  deep learning models for keyphrase extraction and generation from text documents.

* **Transformer based framework** - transformerkp framework builds directly on [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), 
  making it easy to train and evaluate your own transformer based keyphrase extraction and generation models and experiment with 
  new approaches using different contextual embeddings.

* **A dataset library for keyphrase extraction and generation ** - transformerkp has simple interfaces that allow you 
  to download several benchmark datasets in the domain of keyphrase extraction and generation from 
  [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) and readily use them for training and evaluating
  your models. It provides easy access to **BIO** tagged data for several datasets such as **Inspec**, **NUS**, 
  **WWW**, **KDD**, **KP20K**, **LDKP** and many more suitable for training your keyphrase extraction model as a sequence tagger.

* **An evaluation library for keyphrase extraction and generation ** - transformerkp implements several evaluation metrics 
  for evaluating keyphrase extraction and generation models such as ** F1 **, ** F1@m **, ** F1@k ** and helps to generate evaluation 
  reports for your models.

A transformers based deep learning library for keyphrase identification from text documents.

** transformerkp ** is:

* **A deep learning keyphrase extraction and generation library** - transformerkp allows you to train and apply state-of-the-art 
  deep learning models for keyphrase extraction and generation from text documents.

* **Transformer based framework.** transformerkp framework builds directly on [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), 
  making it easy to train and evaluate your own transformer based keyphrase extraction and generation models and experiment with 
  new approaches using different contextual embeddings.

* **A dataset library for keyphrase extraction and generation ** - transformerkp has simple interfaces that allow you 
  to download several benchmark datasets in the domain of keyphrase extraction and generation from 
  [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) and readily use them for training and evaluating
  your models. It provides easy access to BIO tagged data for several datasets such as Inspec, NUS, 
  WWW, KDD, KP20K, LDKP and many more suitable for training your keyphrase extraction model as a sequence tagger.

* **An evaluation library for keyphrase extraction and generation ** - transformerkp implements several evaluation metrics 
  for evaluating keyphrase extraction and generation models such as ** F1 **, ** F1@m **, ** F1@k ** and helps to generate evaluation 
  reports for your models.
